## Why take this class?
This class covers a lot of topics that are used in upper level classes. 
In many of the upper level courses, the topics are not explained, but are used.
For example, in 412, there is a programming assignment for threading that includes a bash script,
but we are never taught how to write bash scripts in class.
This class provides a good explanation on how to write bash scripts, thus offers a great baseline.
